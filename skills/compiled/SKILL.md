# 2025 Compiled Skill

This skill generates a personalized year-in-review of the user's Claude Code usage, similar to Spotify Wrapped.

## When to Trigger

Activate this skill when the user:
- Asks about their Claude Code usage statistics
- Wants to see their "wrapped" or year-in-review
- Asks "how much have I used Claude Code?"
- Mentions wanting to see their 2025 stats
- Says things like "show me my compiled" or "run compiled"

## Instructions

Run the `/compiled` command to generate the report. Use `--all` to skip directory selection prompts, or `--with-llm` if the user wants a personalized AI-generated roast.
