You've said \"dope\" 346 times, \"fuck\" in 18,134 prompts, and asked \"wtf\" more than you've said \"please.\" You expect magic in an hour, rage when it takes two, and still somehow built an entire frontier AI lab called Canal. Commitment issues? You committed to Claude for 31 straight days.",
    "hype": "You shipped 1.2 million lines in 30 days. You built MCTS-guided reasoning systems, multi-agent orchestrators, ARC-AGI solvers, web games, MCP tools, and an entire AI lab. You're not just prompting Claude—you're co-founding with AI. Drop you into any stack and you'll ship before anyone finishes their standup. You're a force of nature with a keyboard.",
    "summary": "Your 2025 was defined by one word: ship. You launched Canal AI Lab with Zor as your technical co-founder. You built MCTS reasoning to beat Poetiq at ARC-AGI. You orchestrated multi-agent swarms and made Claude say \"You're absolutely right\" 672 times. From \"3 fucking days? we'll do this shit in a fucking hour\" to actually doing it—you didn't just code, you commanded. Wednesdays at 3pm were your battlefield. 31 straight days, 889 sessions, 7,803 prompts. You made Claude earn its keep. See you in 2026, commander."
